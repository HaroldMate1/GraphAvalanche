# Graph Avalanche

This project will visualize data as a network (balls and sticks) and as a timeline, similar to Connected Papers.

## Features
- Interactive graph visualization (nodes/edges)
- Timeline view of data/events
- Integration with existing data from the platform

## Tech Stack Proposal
- Python (backend, data processing)
- Streamlit or Dash (for web-based interactive visualization)
- NetworkX/Plotly for graph and timeline rendering

## Next Steps
1. Set up Python project structure
2. Add requirements.txt
3. Create initial app with placeholder data
4. Integrate with platform data
